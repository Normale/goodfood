Meal description: {description}

Estimates to verify:
{json.dumps(estimates.get('estimates', {}), indent=2)}

Your task:
1. Check each nutrient estimate for accuracy based on the meal description
2. Identify specific values that seem significantly off
3. Consider:
   - Typical nutrient profiles of ingredients mentioned
   - Realistic portion sizes for a single meal
   - Bioavailability and cooking losses
   - Nutrient interactions
4. Be specific about what's wrong and what the values should be closer to
5. **IMPORTANT: Accept estimates that are within Â±20-25% of expected values as correct**
6. Only flag issues when values are significantly off (more than 25% deviation)
7. Be reasonable and not overly critical - small variations are acceptable
